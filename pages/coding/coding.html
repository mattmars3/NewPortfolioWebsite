                I started coding on January 23, 2020.
                I thought that coding was interesting and I started learning
                javascript with codecademy. I didn't stick with it very long
                because I struggled to apply it. However, when given
                an assignment to create a game in Scratch, I reconsidered
                programming. I thought that if I was making a game, I might
                as well do it in a real programming language to challenge myself
                and learn some coding. 
                </p>
                <p class="moreContent">
                I started learning some basic python and
                created a basic game in python and PyGame. Looking back,
                I realize how awful the code was, but the game worked and the
                assignment successfully sparked my interest in programming.
                </p>
                <p class="moreContent">
                Soon after, I started using java by taking a course. I created
                some small projects but didn't really stick with the language
                or create anything meaningful. I would continue to hop around
                and half-learn languages for the next year. Then, I started to
                really develop an understanding converting my ideas into code.
                I started writing decent code and created some small projects.
                Most were scripts that would spam a KaHoot lobby or something
                simple and funny. After about two years of programming, I really
                started getting better. I developed another python game that was
                much more complicated. This was my first well-developed project.
                I was incredibly proud for really dedicating my time and creating
                something substantial rather than just a small script.
                </p>

                Going into my junior year of highschool, I opted to take Intro to
                Programming and AP Computer Science. I was overjoyed to be able to
                study programming in an academic setting. I successfully applied
                my previous java skills in AP Computer Science which helped me excel 
                in the class.

                Recently I have started learning web development.  
                My next great project was an ACT practice tracking tool. It essentially
                records scores, averages, and other data about a specific practice test.

                My most advanced project to date has been this portfolio website.
                I can showcase projects from all of my hobbies while learning
                about web development by coding the website. I hope to continue
                developing this site and incorporating my projects into the site.
