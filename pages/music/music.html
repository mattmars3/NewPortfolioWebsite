            <h3>
                The Beginning
            </h3>
            <p>
                My music journey started when I was 9 years old. 
                I was exposed to guitar by my Uncle Mark. 
                He showed me a new video game that would teach you how to play guitar. 
                The game was called Rocksmith. It is essentially Guitar Hero with the addition of  
                plugging a real guitar into your console. It would even judge how accurately you 
                play and offer advice on how to improve. I clearly remember playing this game at
                his house and enjoying the challenge of the game while playing a real guitar.
                The song that I played that day and the song that got me into playing guitar was
                "American Idiot" by Green Day. After this day I was sure I wanted to learn 
                to play guitar.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Getting Started
            </h3>
            <p>
                I ordered my first guitar on June 4, 2014 and got it two days later on June 6
                along with a copy of Rocksmith 2014.  
                The gamification of Rocksmith helped me practice often and I started
                improving rapidly. I was completely addicted. I would continue learning to play
                 through Rocksmith and YouTube for roughly the next two years.
            </p>

            <h3>
                First Solo
            </h3>
            <p>
                The first solo that I learned how to play was 
                "Nothing Else Matters" by Metallica. I performed it at my brother's 8th grade 
                graduation party as a 5th grader. This was the first time I really performed in front of a crowd
                despite the crowd being my brothers friends and their families.
                My biggest influences at the start of my playing career were
                Rush, Metallica, and Jimi Hendrix.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Influential People
            </h3>
            <p>
                There were many people that were crucial in supporting my musical journey. 
                My immediate family was always supportive and loved seeing and hearing my 
                progress blasting throughout the house. My mom, dad, and brother all supported me in
                each step of the learning process. One of the most influential person
                in my music career has been my Uncle Mark. Not only was he the one that introduced
                me to guitar, but he has also been extremely generous in lending me guitars, amps,
                and other equipment. I would never be at the point I am at with guitar, or, maybe
                not even playing guitar without the influence of my Uncle Mark. Another important
                person was my neighbor and family friend Mr. Jeff P. Since he was a neighbor and close friend of my family, he was around a lot and gave me lots of playing advice.
                My greatest supporter has been my father. He helped guide me by introducing me
                to new music and would always be willing to drive me to guitar center or listen to me
                play guitar.

            <h3>
                Starting Lessons
            </h3>
            <p>
                After being self-taught for nearly two years, I decided to join School Of Rock.
                I joined a performance and lesson program where the school schedules shows, 
                picks songs, teaches those songs to the students, etc.
                The theme of the first show was Cheap Trick vs Aerosmith. 
                I had my first lesson on April 23, 2016 where I learned "Auf Wiedersehen" by
                Trick. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                First Concert
            </h3>
            <p>
                I practiced my songs for a few months and played my first full concert
                on September 18, 2016 at Reggie's in Chicago. 
                Some songs I played were: (Aerosmith) Walk this Way, Love in an Elevator, 
                and Sweet Emotion, and (Cheap Trick) ELO Kiddies, Hello There,
                Auf Wiedersehen, and You're All Talk.
                My next show was a week after that
            </p>
            <h3>
                Highschool Rock Band
            </h3>
            <p>
                In May of 2019, I auditioned and made the St. Francis Rock Band. I was beyond excited
                to continue my guitar playing career in a school environment.
