                The Beginning
            </h3>
                <p>
                    My music journey started when I was 9 years old. 
                    I was exposed to guitar by my Uncle Mark. 
                    He showed me a new video game that would teach you how to play guitar. 
                    The game was called Rocksmith. It is essentially Guitar Hero except you 
                    plug a real guitar into your console and it will judge how accurately you 
                    play and offer advice on how to improve. I clearly remember playing this game at
                    his house and enjoying the challenge of the game while playing a real guitar.
                    The song that I played that day and the song that got me into playing guitar was
                    "American Idiot" by Green Day. After this day I was sure I wanted to learn 
                    to play guitar.
                </p>

                    Getting Started
                </h3>
                <p class="moreContent">
                    I ordered my first guitar on June 4, 2014 and got it two days later on June 6
                    along with a copy of Rocksmith 2014. I was completely addicted. 
                    The gamification of Rocksmith helped me practice often and I started
                    improving rapidly. I would continue learning to play through Rocksmith 
                    and YouTube for roughly the next two years.

                    First Solo
                </h3>
                <p class="moreContent">
                    The first solo that I learned how to play was 
                    "Nothing Else Matters" by Metallica. I performed it at my brother's 8th grade 
                    graduation party. This was the first time I really performed in front of a crowd
                    despite the crowd being my brothers friends and their families.
                    My biggest influences at the start of my playing career were
                    Rush, Metallica, and Jimi Hendrix.
